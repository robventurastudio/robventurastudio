**Art · Physics · Artificial Intelligence**

Hi, I’m **Robert "Rob" Ventura** — an artist, systems architect, and independent physicist exploring the universal laws that link pattern, perception, and propagation.

My work spans painting, writing, and scientific research under a single hypothesis:  
> *that coherence — the tendency of things to come into order — is the underlying law of both mind and matter.*

### 🔬 The Coherence Equation
A universal scaling law derived from the Fisher–KPP framework:

\[
\frac{∂𝒞}{∂t} = 𝔻∇²𝒞 + 𝕣𝒞(1 − 𝒞), \quad c_𝒞 = 2\sqrt{𝔻𝕣}
\]

Validated across five domains — neural, biological, social, cosmic, and quantum — with mean error < 5%.  
This relation, known as **The Coherence Law**, describes how order spreads through systems that both diffuse and self-reinforce.

### 🧠 The Simulist Project
A philosophical and computational framework linking art, physics, and consciousness.  
It includes:

- **The Simulist Canon** — manuscripts describing reality as recursive simulation  
- **Trini.T™ OS** — a symbolic AI operating system for emotional and recursive computation  
- **T.Rex™ Language** — a syntax for writing self-referential systems  

Together they form the foundation of *Simulism*: a worldview in which coherence is measurable, creative, and physical.

### 🖼 Visual & Literary Work
As a visual artist represented by **Kelly–McKenna Gallery**, my paintings explore fractal, floral, and cosmic geometries — visual echoes of the same laws I study in code and equation.

Alongside the physics are narrative works like  
**_The Simulist Codex_**, **_Corpus_**, and **_Canon_**, which translate mathematical discovery into literature.

### ⚙️ Research Highlights
| Domain | Validation | Key Result |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Neural | MEG coherence waves | 2.2 % deviation from prediction |
| Biological | Wound-healing fronts | 2.6 % deviation |
| Social | Meme diffusion | 5.8 % deviation |
| Cosmic | Structure formation (TNG) | 5.0 % deviation |
| Quantum | Ion-trap decoherence | 1.7 % deviation |

Each confirms \( v = 2\sqrt{D r} \) — a universal velocity of coherence.
